Introduction
=============

The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the creation of an Angular
project from scratch, while showing you how to integrate the
`Stormpath Angular SDK`_ to achieve the following tasks in your Angular
application:

* User Login
* User Registration
* Password Reset
* Access Control

If you're a seasoned AngularJS developer and simply want to explore the
module API, you can visit the `Stormpath AngularJS SDK API Documentation`_.

What We're Building
--------------------

In this guide we will create a simple API server that our Angular application
will use using Node.js.  If you wish to create a server using Java, please see
our `Java Web App Plugin Guide`_.  For other environments please visit
`Stormpath Docs`_ to see if we have an integration for you!

By the end of this guide we will create the following:

**A fullstack project & workflow**.  We're going to create a project with a lot
of boilerplate code, but don't worry, it's going to be created automatically for
you!  This is the power of Yeoman.

**A Node.js server**.  This server will serve the assets for the Angular
application.  It will also serve a simple API, which we will secure with
Stormpath.

**An Angular application**.  This will be an HTML5-based application, which
allows users to register, login, and see their profile.  We will control profile
access so that only logged-in users can access that view.

Example Project
--------------------

As you follow this tutorial, you will be creating and editing files.  If you're
uncertain about a certain step, you can compare your code to the example project
in this folder of the SDK repository:
