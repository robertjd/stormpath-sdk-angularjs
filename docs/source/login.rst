Create the Login Form
============================

Login forms are pretty straightforward, why re-invent the wheel? The `Stormpath
Angular SDK`_ includes a default login form that you can be quickly inserted
into your application via an Angular directive.  To use it, we need to create a
Login route and a view in our application.

Generate the /login Route
--------------------------------

We can use Yeoman to create the Angular route and view at the same time.

Stop the server, then run the following command in your project folder::

    $ yo angular-fullstack:route login

It will ask you the following questions, so just hit enter to choose the defaults for all of them::

    ? Where would you like to create this route? client/app/
    ? What will the url of your route be? /login

It will then tell you about the files it has created::

  create client/app/login/login.js
  create client/app/login/login.controller.js
  create client/app/login/login.controller.spec.js
  create client/app/login/login.css
  create client/app/login/login.html

Use the Login Form Directive
--------------------------------

Open the file ``client/app/login/login.html`` and then replace
its contents with the following:

.. code-block:: html

    <div ng-include="'components/navbar/navbar.html'"></div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
          <h3>Login</h3>
          <hr>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div sp-login-form></div>
    </div>

This is a small bit of HTML markup, which does the following:

* Includes the common menu bar for the application (we customized it in the last section).
* Sets up some Bootstrap classes so that the page flows nicely.
* Inserts the default login form via the `spLoginForm`_ directive.

Save that file and restart the server via ``grunt serve``. Now, when you click
the Login link, you should now see the login route like this:

.. image:: _static/login_form.png

Perfect!  Now that we have a login form, we also need the ability to register
for an account.  Continue on to the next section and we will build a registration form.

If you want to further customize the look and behavior of the form,
please see the API documentation for the `spLoginForm`_ directive.
The most useful feature is the ability to specify your own template.
