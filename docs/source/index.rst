Welcome to Stormpath's AngularJS + Yeoman Guide!
=================================================

.. image:: _static/awesome.png

This guide will show you how to create an Angular application that uses the Stormpath
User Management Service to handle user registration and login.  We will show you how to:

* Begin an Angular application from scratch, using Grunt, Yeoman and Bower.
* Create a simple REST API and secure it with Oauth Access Tokens (JWTs).  We will use Express.js for the server.
* Control access to views in the Angular application.
* Fetch information about the user from your API.
* Render your UI based on the current user state.
